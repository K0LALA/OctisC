# Octis

This game is based on **Tetris** but this time as a 2-player game where the goal is to make the oppponent place a block over the limit.<br>
<br>
This version of the game is written entirely in C.<br>
This same game is also written in [Python](https://github.com/K0LALA/OctisTerminal) but has less features.<br>

You are free to use the entirety of the idea and the code as you wish as this was made for eductional purposes.
